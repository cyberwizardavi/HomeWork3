# HomeWork3

It was a good learning experience, had to do much research to get it working.

Some resources :

Question:

In the text field where we are entering value to add to the list, even if I hit spacebar instead of typing in any value, the array gets
the value and makes the Add button active. I saw it in the example app of yours as well. Is there a way to check for space in
text box? Or any unwanted value for that matter?
